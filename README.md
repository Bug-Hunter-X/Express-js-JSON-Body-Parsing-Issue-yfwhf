This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where JSON request bodies are not parsed correctly if the `Content-Type` header is missing or incorrect. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The original code uses `app.use(express.json())` to enable JSON body parsing.  However, if a client sends a POST request without the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header, Express.js will not parse the request body, leading to `req.body` being empty. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in the application.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the client sends the correct `Content-Type` header. The updated code also includes error handling to gracefully manage situations where JSON parsing fails.
